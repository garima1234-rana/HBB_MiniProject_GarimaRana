#Tasks Covered

1. Sequence Retrievalfrom NCBI  
2. BLAST Analysis to find homologs in other species  
3. Pairwise Alignment (e.g. Human vs Chimpanzee, Zebrafish)  
4. Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA)using Clustal Omega  
5. Sequence Logo Generation** via Skylign  
6. Phylogenetic Tree Construction** in MEGA X  
7. Interpretation of evolutionary relationships  


# Tools Used
